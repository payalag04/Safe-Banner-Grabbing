ABSTRACT :-
Though playing an essential role in server-client communications, the connections between them are vulnerable to banner grabbing attacks. Banner grabbing is a method used by attackers and security teams as a technique to gather data about network computer systems and services that are running on open ports. Banner is a text that is displayed by a host server containing details like the type of software and the OS version running on the system being used along with other system information on the network. However, this width of information makes the system vulnerable by giving cybercriminals a leg up on attacking the network. 
In this study, we plan to indulge into the theory and implementation of banner grabbing, its attacks, and the available counter measures to understand the topic at depth and then try and propose a self-evolved counter measure to be safe from the negative impacts of banner grabbing attacks.
